    "To have the first game of a European Championship in our own country at one of the most historic, iconic Premier League grounds, I think it’s a massive statement from the FA in terms of the way that they’ve organised this tournament," England manager Phil Neville told UEFA.com.
    
    "To play games at Wembley is what my players have dreamt about; to play in front of a packed Wembley Stadium, a packed Old Trafford, a packed Southampton, it’s really bucket list-type dreams that they’ve had."
